Description: This package implements an approach for scanning the
  genome to detect and perform accurate inference on differentially 
  methylated regions from Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing data. 
  The method is based on comparing detected regions 
  to a pooled null distribution, that can be implemented even when as 
  few as two samples per population are available. 
  Region-level statistics are obtained by fitting a generalized 
  least squares (GLS) regression model with a nested autoregressive  
  correlated error structure for the effect of interest on transformed  
  methylation proportions.
